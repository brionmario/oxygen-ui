## Introduction

Oxygen UI is a design system built on top of Material UI (v5). 
It is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications with basic use cases.

Here you can find our design guidelines, component documentation, and resources on Oxygen UI Design System.

## Our principles

Our design principles were developed based on best practices to ensure top-notch user experience, accessibility, stickiness, and
delight.
